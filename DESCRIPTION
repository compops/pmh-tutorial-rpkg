Description: Routines for state estimate in a linear
    Gaussian state space model and a simple stochastic volatility model using
    particle filtering. Parameter inference is also carried out in these models
    using the particle Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that includes the particle
    filter to provided an unbiased estimator of the likelihood. This package is 
    a collection of minimal working examples of these algorithms and is only 
    meant for educational use and as a start for learning to them on your own.
