## Purpose
This package provides minimal working examples for implementing the particle Metropolis-Hastings (PMH) algorithm for parameter inference in non-linear state space models. The package accompanies the tutorial:

J. Dahlin and T. B. Sch√∂n, **Getting started with particle Metropolis-Hastings for inference in nonlinear models**. Pre-print, arXiv:1511:01707, 2017.

The tutorial is available as a preprint from http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.01707. Additional stane-alone code is provided for Python and MATLAB in the GitHub repo http://www.github.com/compops/pmh-tutorial. This repo also contains R code, which is almost identical to the code provided in the package. 

## Usage
The main functions of the package are the five examples connected to the tutorial:

* **example1_lgss()** Demostrates the particle filter for estimating the
state in a linear Gaussian state space model.

* **example2_lgss()** Demostrates PMH for estimating the parameters in a 
linear Gaussian state space model.

* **example3_sv()** Demostrates PMH for estimating the parameters in a 
stochastic volatility model.

* **example4_sv()** Demostrates PMH for estimating the parameters in a 
stochastic volatility model using a tailored proposal distribution.

* **example5_sv()** Demostrates PMH for estimating the parameters in a 
stochastic volatility model using a reparameterised model.

## Simple example
The examples can be executed by e.g.
``` R
example2_lgss()
``` 
which will recreate on of the plots in the aforementioned tutorial. See the reference for more background and details.

## How do I get it?
The package is available through CRAN and can be installed by
``` R
install.packages("pmhtutorial")
``` 
or directly from GitHub by
``` R
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("compops/pmh-tutorial-rpkg/package")
``` 
or downloaded as a binary from GitHub https://github.com/compops/pmh-tutorial-rpkg/releases/download/v1.1/pmhtutorial_1.1.tar.gz.


## Dependencies
The package requires Quandl and mvtnorm to be able to download financial data from the Internet and to generate random variables from the multivariate Gaussian distribution. These can be installed by executing
``` R
install.packages(c("Quandl", "mvtnorm"))
``` 
in the R console if it is not installed at the same time as this package.
