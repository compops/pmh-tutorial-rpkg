\title{State estimation in a linear Gaussian state space model}
\usage{
example1_lgss()
}
\value{
Returns a plot with the generated observations y and the difference in the
state estimates obtained by the Kalman filter (the optimal solution) and 
the particle filter (with 20 particles). Furthermore, the function returns 
plots of the estimated bias and mean squared error of the state estimate 
obtained using the particle filter (while varying the number of particles) 
and the Kalman estimates.

The function returns a list with the elements:
\itemize{
\item{y: The observations generated from the model.}
\item{x: The states generated from the model.}
\item{kfEstimate: The estimate of the state from the Kalman filter.}
\item{pfEstimate: The estimate of the state from the particle filter with 
20 particles.}
}
}
\description{
Minimal working example of state estimation in a linear Gaussian state 
space model using Kalman filtering and a fully-adapted particle filter. 
The code estimates the bias and mean squared error (compared with the 
Kalman estimate) while varying the number of particles in the particle 
filter.
}
\details{
The Kalman filter is a standard implementation without an input. The 
particle filter is fully adapted (i.e. takes the current observation into 
account when proposing new particles and computing the weights).
